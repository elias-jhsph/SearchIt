# Search It

## Basic Description
Lets say you have a list of 100 scientific names of flowers. If you save it as a .txt file and open in with Search It then you can work your way though looking up those flowers in Google systematically. You can also add up to six combinations of headers and footers so that instead of looking up 
"Cuphea ignea"
"Rudbeckia hirta" 
You could look up...
"Habitat of Cuphea ignea"
"Cuphea ignea common name"
"Habitat of Rudbeckia hirta"
"Rudbeckia hirta common name"

## Warnings
THIS IS NOT A FINISHED APPLICATION. I am not responsible if Google or any other site you put into the alternate search field thinks you are a robot. Also this is for personal use only. You must get my permission to use this to make money. Feel free to check back for updates though. [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
